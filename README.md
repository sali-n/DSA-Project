# DSA-Project

My end of semester project in data structures and algorithms.

For this project, we were required to read in 6 sets of data all of increasing length and then test the
insertion, find, sorted traversal and deletion on 4 different data structures: Linked-List, Hashtable, Array and Binary Search Tree (BST)
based upon both the execution time and memory consumption.
